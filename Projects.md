# Misty Meadows - Create events and RSVP for them - a minimal clone of Eventbrite

I collaborated with three of my classmates and built an application which allows users to create and RSVP for upcoming events. We used the Node.js Express framework and Bootstrap CSS on Cloud9 IDE to develop and test the website and Heroku to deploy the app. Git version control and Waffle.io were used to maintain issues raised by the team.
