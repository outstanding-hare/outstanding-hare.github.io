I am a second year MBA student at the <a href = "www.som.yale.edu" target="_blank">Yale School of Management. </a> This website is a repository of my experiences and thoughts from my time at Yale. I will also try and use this space to answer some of the bigger questions that have confronted me through the past few years, such as Why MBA? Why Yale? and Why now?

I am an engineer by training and graduated with a B.E. in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from <a href = "http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/Goa/" target = "_blank">BITS Pilani, Goa Campus</a>. However, my passion for education propelled me to jump into the social sector post engineering. I taught 4th and 5th grade students in a municipal school in Pune as a <a href = "http://teachforindia.org/" target="_blank">Teach For India fellow</a>. Post fellowship, I joined the founding team of <a href="http://www.stireducation.org/" target="_blank">STIR Education</a>, a start-up with the mission to empower teachers as changemakers. You can find my thoughts on Teach For India <a href="https://iteachforindia.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">here</a>. I have also documented my classroom experience <a href = "https://humariclass.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">here </a>and some of my random musings <a href="http://ankahi.tumblr.com/" target ="_blank">here</a>.
