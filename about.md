I am a second year MBA student at the <a href = "www.som.yale.edu" target="_blank">Yale School of Management. </a> This website is a repository of my experiences and thoughts from my time at Yale. I will also try and use this space to answer some of the bigger questions that have confronted me through the past few years, such as Why MBA? Why Yale? and Why now?

I believe in changing the world for better, one step at a time. This belief had propelled me to take up the challenge of becoming a teacher in a municipal school. I have collaborated with my co-teacher to document our roller-coaster ride of leading a classroom to success <a href = "https://humariclass.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">here</a> and you can also find some of my random musings <a href="http://ankahi.tumblr.com/" target ="_blank">here</a>.
