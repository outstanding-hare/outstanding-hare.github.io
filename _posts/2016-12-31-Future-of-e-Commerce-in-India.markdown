> The future depends on what we do in the present. 

&nbsp;

A couple of weeks ago, I had a recruiting related call with a large investor who has significant stakes in the Indian e-Commerce space and in order to come across as someone who is familiar with the space, I did some research on who is doing what in India. I ended up speaking with a couple of my friends engaged in e-Commerce companies and read a few analyst reports on the future of e-Commerce in India. In this post, I have tried to summarize some of the key things that I have understood and have also shared a few good resources to read/view if you are interested in the space.

<span style="color:#e54c2d">**So, what has happened so far?**</span> Less than 1% of total retail in India was captured by e-Commerce in India in 2015 which was about 14-15B USD. It’s a trillion dollar market and e-Commerce is expected to be about 55 B by 2018. The last number is open to contest as different agencies and analyst have their own expectations, however, what seems certain is that e-Commerce will gain a higher percentage of India’s organized retail and may capture the unorganized market as well in future. That said, everyone has been able to see this as a great opportunity and thus, many large and small players have been fighting for the market. This includes, [Flipkart](http://www.flipkart.com/) that was the first mover in the market, [Amazon](http://www.amazon.in/) the big daddy of e-Commerce, [Snapdeal](https://www.snapdeal.com/) that started off with a deal and coupon website but forayed into an e-Commerce platform, [PayTM](https://paytm.com/) which opened shop as an e-Wallet and subsequently moved into retail , [Shopclues](http://www.shopclues.com/) the online flea market and many other vertical players such as [Zivame](http://zivame.com/), [Urban Ladder](https://www.urbanladder.com/), [Grofers](https://grofers.com/), [Indian roots](http://www.indianroots.com/), [hopscotch](https://www.hopscotch.in/) and many more. 

For the last few years, everyone has been focused on the growth and not profitability, which meant reaching the population not just in the metros but tier 1, tier 2 and tier 3 cities. (Tiers are based on population size of the cities. With metros having population more than a million, tier 1 cities include those that have a population between 500k and a million, tier 2 between 100k and 500k and so on.) This also meant that the metrics for success included: *no of customers, how often they buy, how much they buy and speed of delivery*. Flipkart says that about half its sales come from outside India’s big cities. Snapdeal claims more than 60%. It recently launched seven regional-language versions of its website. Every player has been spending heavily on discounts to lure customers into buying from their websites. 

<span style="color:#e54c2d">**What’s changing?**</span> Customer acquisition costs are extremely high because of deep discounting and everyone has realized that retention costs are high as well as Indian consumer is a deal hunter to a large extent. Which explains the rise of startups such as [My Smart Price](http://www.mysmartprice.com/) and [Makkhichoose](http://makkhichoose.com/) that help consumers find the products at the cheapest price by scraping multiple websites for the same products. The VCs who have been sinking money in the hope of an exit don’t seem to see the exit opportunity coming anytime soon as all the firms are still in the growth phase and aren’t even earning operating profits. Customer loyalty is low and most services that were used to differentiate offerings such as 2 day delivery, scheduled delivery, returns etc have been commoditized and are being provided by everyone which again makes it easier for a consumer to switch between sites. At Harvard India Conference, Rahul Narvekar from Indian Roots didn’t shy from giving an example of how many consumers abuse the Cash On Delivery feature by ordering the same product from multiple sites and end up keeping the one that arrives first. Thus, returning the delivery guys from other companies with their products. Some investors are getting frustrated while others are making aggressive bets to see some profits. Vertical players such as Lenskart, Urban Ladder and Zivame are already trying to bring the efficiencies of online channels to offline stores by opening their own brick and mortar stores across many cities. This omnichannel model would help with brand creation and recognition as consumers will have the touch and feel of traditional stores and will be able to order from the large assortment of products that online stores offer. 

<span style="color:#e54c2d">**What do I think will happen next?** </span> A lot of experimentation, some consolidation, and many new partnerships to move towards profitable sustainable businesses. Why do I think so? With the discounts and huge expenditure on setting the infrastructure the investments have been incredible. All of this means that only a large player such as Amazon with long standing experience of following an aggressive model of burning a lot of cash to create name and systems will continue playing this game in the hope that others will die. The smaller players will have to innovate fast to change the game from getting consumers online to making business profitable with those who are already online. The investor’s frustration to see quick exit will make this process of innovating to a profitable model faster for a few and will kill a few others. Vertical players will have to make certain decisions – omnichannel or pure online? Multiple brands or single brand? These are hard decisions and would depend on the product being traded. For example, Zivame that was selling well known and recognized brands with deep discounts has moved to selling its own products. In the short run this may mean losing customers who were more loyal to some brands and were on Zivame only for the deals, however, in the long run it would mean that Zivame itself becomes a favored brand with its own loyal customers. These decisions will also depend on the frequency of the product being purchased for example Urban Ladder’s business will be very different from that of Grofers for consumers don’t buy furniture everyday but would be repeat grocery customers. This means that Grofers can grow a lot even by sticking to a few cities and making sure that it gains the loyalty of its customers by ensuring superior and convenient service. This leads to an important point that is partnerships. E-Commerce businesses, just like any other business require a host of services and it is hard for one company to be an expert in all of them which is where partnerships come into picture. Now these partnerships could be as simple as Book My Show partnering with PayTM to sell tickets to PayTM users which would help Book My Show gain access to PayTM’s users and PayTM will be able to provide an additional service to its users. The question to ask is whether PayTM should partner with Book My Show or should compete with Book My Show by partnering directly with multiplexes. This would depend on the size of decision maker’s company, speed of execution and implementation ability. One way or the other partnerships will benefit the businesses. 

*I will share my thoughts on the future of Amazon vs Flipkart vs Snapdeal vs Paytm in a later post.*
