Earlier this year I went to China as part of the Global Studies Requirement at SOM. Out of the many options such as International Experience trips, Global Network Week, Global Social Enterprise and SNOOCs that students can choose from, I chose the trip to China while many of my friends were on similar trips to Japan, Serbia, Croatia, South Africa, India and Brazil.
