<span style="color:#e54c2d">Why do I need to have a high GMAT score to get into a top B-School? </span>
I wouldn’t say that it is a naïve question, however, in order to answer that let’s first understand what do Business Schools mean when they say that we look at an application as a whole and GMAT score is just a part of it. 
Schools are true, they look at your work experience, personal experiences outside work, recommendations, undergrad transcripts and what not. They want to say that if you have an outstanding experience that would bring something unique to the class then they may overlook a lower GMAT score. For example, if you have been a trained classical singer/dancer, have performed with the best in your art, have played under 19 squash/tennis as world’s No. 9 player, climbed Mt. Everest, did an expedition to Antarctica or have been to 70 countries and have worked across 4 continents before applying to the school, then it may suffice to have a low GMAT score. You can very clearly see that getting a 730+ score would be a lot easier than any of those previously mentioned achievements. Also, one needs to understand that GMAT scores are taken into consideration to rank the schools as well. Thus schools prefer to have students with high GMATs so that the school average remains high. Now, if I have convinced that you need to have a great score in addition to your stellar work experience, I will try and share a little about preparing for GMAT. 

<span style="color:#e54c2d">Analytical Writing Assessment </span>
AWA is all about structure. Many people shy away from writing and are slightly apprehensive of this section. I want you to know that AWA is more science than writing. There are many examples in the official GMAT guide that will help you understand a clear pattern that every good write-up follows. It will start off with a 3-4 sentences paragraph clearly stating the author’s point and stand. This would follow with 3 paragraphs cogently justifying the author’s stand. Each paragraph would start with ‘First’, ‘Second’ and ‘Third’. There may or may not be a last paragraph summarizing the three points and stating the author’s stand again. This is the simplest part of the exam and as long as you are score 5 on 6 which most people are able to do, you are good to go.

<span style="color:#e54c2d">Integrated Reasoning </span>
I don’t have anything to speak about this section because when I wrote the exam in 2012, IR was recently introduced and there weren’t any resources in the market that I had used. It was like any reasoning test and I didn’t bother too much about it. In fact I hadn’t scored well on it as well. So, I don’t think my advice matters here. 

<span style="color:#e54c2d">Quantitative </span>
Having been through the Indian education system and being an Engineer, going through GMAT’s official guide was enough to prepare for this section. In case you are not comfortable with this section, my advice is to go through R.S. Aggarwal and N.C.E.R.T. books of class 9th and 10th. In addition to that you can also read the Manhattan books. 

<span style="color:#e54c2d">Verbal</span>
This is where many Desis struggle and it’s the most important section to crack in order to get that dream score. In addition to official guide, I would advise reading all Manhattan books. I think there are 8 of them for different Quant and Verbal sections. The ones for sentence correction and critical reasoning are particularly useful. Once you get a little comfortable with the format of the exam and have had a chance to finish the Manhattan books, do take out some time to solve a few online mock exams. There are many free tests that you can write. There are two available on the official GMAT website – www.mba.com as well. It’s always useful to take one of those tests before starting your preparation to know where you stand and the second one at the end of your preparation to see how far you have come. 

There are tons of online resources talking about GMAT and everything I have mentioned above is just my version of the GMAT preparation. Above mentioned books and resources helped me score 750 and that was enough to get me an admission at Yale. All the best with your prep!
