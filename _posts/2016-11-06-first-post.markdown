One must have a solid reasoning behind taking a loan upwards of $140,000, leave a job with an organization one loves, move to a new country away from one's family and enroll in a two year MBA program.

In my case, it was a combination of inspiration, fear of failure by staying in my comfort zone and willingness to seek new experiences that propelled me to come to Yale School of Management to get my MBA. To elaborate:

1. Being a part of the founding team at STIR Education, I got to work closely with the CEO, Sharath Jeevan. He was leading STIR to grow at tremendous pace while keeping the organization lean and focused. Sharath mentored me and inspired me to think about business schools very seriously by sharing a lot of his experiences of going to INSEAD and how his business school experience has helped him become a successful entrepreneur. If not for Sharath, I may not have been as fascinated about business schools as I was. 

2. STIR gave me the opportunity to travel across rural India and a little bit in Uganda. I would go into remote areas and metros alike and work with the leadership of large NGOs like Room to Read, American India Foundation, Pratham etc to help them instituionalize STIR's methodology of working with teachers into their existing structures. I learnt a lot about these organizations but I could also see how businesses were growing across rural areas and transforming the lives of milliosn of people. One could walk into villages and see telecom towers but wouldn’t see schools in 8 mile radius. I felt that despite having great intention and services, many non-profits lack a certain business acumen which prevents them from reaching true scale. In order to increase my own impact, I felt a need to learn more about businesses. I felt that if I don't learn this, I might fail in my mission to alleviate people out of poverty. 

3. And that leads me to the third point which is my willingness to seek new experiences and meet inspiring people. I had lived all my life in India and yet STIR has exposed me to parts of India, I had never seen before. I realized that I had to move out and see more of the world. Live in another country and learn about different cultures. Meet new and interesting people. In addition to that, I have a great network of very smart and driven people from my undergrad school - BITS Pilani in India but I couldn't boast of the same at a global level and I wanted to build that global community that I can go back to and learn from at various points in my career. 

Hence, it’s this urge to acquire business knowledge, gain global experience and build a potential network of successful individuals that contributed to my decision of pursuing MBA. And here I am at Yale!
