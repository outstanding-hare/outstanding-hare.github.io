After having made the decision to apply, I sent in my application to three business schools in the United States. Harvard, Dartmouth and Yale. Harvard, because it's Harvard. Dartmouth - Tuck was my first choice to go to. This is because I had a chance to speak with a few Tuck alums and every single one of them was extremely friendly. They all spoke highly of Tuck and the idea of living in Hanover in the middle of mountains really appealed to me. Anyway, I got waitlisted at Tuck after my interview and they weren't sure if I would be a good fit for the community or not.

Being waitlisted didn't affect me as much because by that time I had heard back from Yale and I had made it to the School of Management. So, to answer the Why Yale question, I applied to Yale because of three very straightforward reasons:

* I felt that I will be able to integrate well with the SOM community, given my background in the social sector. While I was looking at Business schools, I was looking at a place that most resonates with my values and has a good mix of people from multiple cultures but at the same time would be a small class size, where I can feel part of the class. With Yale SOM, I saw these things coming together. SOM’s mission of educating leaders for business and society is something that completely resonated with me. I believe that businesses are a part of the society and need to be contributing to the society and sustainability of the communities that they serve. I had enough on my resume to substantiate that my beliefs resonate with the mission of the school.

* The integrated curriculum and the way SOM is integrated with the wider Yale University attracted me to the school. Although, I must mention that I didn't fully understand the amazing nature of the curriculum until I saw it in action during my first semester here. However, I did understand the fact that I will have the flexibility to attend classes at other Yale schools such as the law school or the forestry school or even undergrad colleges if I wish to take up electives outside of SOM in my 2nd year. That seemed like a good deal to me. 

* I was pleased to see that a lot of SOM alum who came from similar background as mine, were able to go into the direction that I *wanted* to pursue.

Hence, it’s the combination of Yale’s mission, its curriculum, class size and community that brought me here. 

Now, when I am here and have lived in New Haven for the last year and a half that I have come to realize that there is so much more to Yale than what I had imagined. It's hard to understand all of this while applying to b-schools as the process is lengthy and intimidating and almost no international student goes beyond the established means to learn about life at the school. I will try and summarize some of the things that I have experienced at Yale that make this place absolutely wonderful:

* LOCATION - New Haven has the unique advantage of being close to New York and yet having a comparatively low cost of living. Being a small town, every one gets to stay closer to the school and not just save money on the rent but also save any travel time that many of my peers at other business schools end up spending on their daily commutes. Many of us do travel to New York once in a while either for recruiting related meetings or to chill out in the big apple and metro north provides a convenient commute to the city. 

* ART & THEATER - [Yale Art Gallery](http://artgallery.yale.edu/), [Yale Rep](https://www.yalerep.org/), [Cabaret](http://yalecabaret.org/) and [the orchestra](http://yso.yalecollege.yale.edu/) have been the best source of entertainment for me at a very affordable price. There is no way that I could have attended shows of this incredible level living in a large city for the price that I pay with my student pass here at Yale. 

* FOOD - After having spent hours working on projects/assignments, all you can ask for is good food and a good place to hang out with friends. Surprisingly, New Haven has some of the best restaurants serving delicious cuisines from all over the world.

I can keep on building the list but then the opportunity cost of investing time on this post is pretty high ;)
